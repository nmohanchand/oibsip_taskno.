					<h2>Basketball <br><span>Be Creative!</span></h2>
					<p>Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world and one of the most widely viewed. It is a team sport that involves two teams of five active players each trying to score points against one another by throwing a ball through a 300 cm (10 feet) high hoop (the ‘basket’) under organised rules. It is played on both indoor and outdoor courts.

						The size of the court, height of the basket, size of the basketball, and length of time that the game is played, can all vary according to the age, size and skill level of players.
						
						Basketball is a fast moving game that involves a lot of variety, including shooting, dribbling, passing, rebounding, defence and much more. </p>
